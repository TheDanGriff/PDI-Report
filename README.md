### üöÄ About PDI

The Pitcher Deception Index (PDI) addresses a fundamental gap in baseball analytics by providing the first objective measure of pitch deception. Using a Siamese neural network trained on 626,217 pitch pairs, PDI captures the "early similarity + late divergence" pattern that makes pitches deceptive to batters.
